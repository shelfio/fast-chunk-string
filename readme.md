## Install

```
$ yarn add @shelf/fast-chunk-string
```

## Usage

```js
import fastChunkString from '@shelf/fast-chunk-string';

// the fastest way
fastChunkString('unicorns', {size: 2, unicodeAware: false});
// => ['un', 'ic', 'or', 'ns']

// ignore unicode, still fast but inaccurate
fastChunkString('😀😃😄😁', {size: 2, unicodeAware: false});
// => ['😀', '😃', '😄', '😁']

// respect unicode, slow but accurate
fastChunkString('😀😃😄😁', {size: 2, unicodeAware: true});
// => ['😀😃', '😄😁']
```
